                <p>
                    Mzamomtsha started as a small school project for primarily 
                    learner's who stayed around Driftsands in Khayelitsha, but 
                    because every project can either grow or not. Ours grew, the 
                    population grew and the children grew. So the school had to also 
                    grow. We decided to be a high school also to accommodate our 
                    learner's who were coming from our primary. We are still running 
                    and standing as we speak.
