          <p>
              Mzamomtsha started as a small school project for primarily learner's who stayed around Driftsands in Khayelitsha, but because every project can either grow or not ours grew ,the population grew and the children grew. So the school had talso grow. We decided to be a high school also to accommodate our learner's who were coming from our primary. We are still running and standing as we speak.
